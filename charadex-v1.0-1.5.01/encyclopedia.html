                  Two gods. Siblings. Alone in the vastness of the universe. Destruction and Creation. The debate the two could not get rid of their heads for rotations. Out of their rivality, they chose an untouched world. A vessel; to use as a way to see who was right. 
                  Creating two separate sentient and intelligent creatures to rule the world. With one thing in common, their unexplained hatred towards the opposite tribe. Left to just sit and watch how it would develop. Whatever their primitive minds desired. They choose a random planet with established fauna, they called it, Vahonea.
                </p>
                    <p>Valdor, god of destruction, the older sibling, at a snowy slope of the mountains, the village of the <a href="species.html#silgans">Silgans.</a> 
                    <br>
                    Silar God of Creation, the younger sibling, created a luscious green field the village of <a href="species.html#morrokes">Morrokes</a>. 
                    </p>
                    Morrokes, almost immediately realized they where not strong enough on their own, so they tamed and named a native creature of the world, <a href="companions.html#garbles">garbles</a>.  A symbiotic relationship. Garbles helped with crops and heavy materials in construction and in return Morrokes limed down their tusks and spines/spikes. 
                    Valdor did not think progress was going quick enough. Silgans rarely left the perimeter of their walled off village.
                    They did master the skills of creating weaponry exponentially fast. 
                    <br>
                     But, from the oldest tree trunks of millinery silk trees of the forest, Valdor created <a href="companions.html#okres">Oâ€™kres</a> . Brutal creatures that could tear skin and bones in one ferocious bite.
                     <br>
                      To help Silgans with the heavy duty tasks like Garbles where doing back at Morrokes tribe. 
                    Yet still, the younger sibling concentrated on not not intervening, only watching from a distance for Morrokes to grow themselves.

                    Back at the morroke tribe, things wherent looking the geratest at the beginning. Morrokes needed a bit of a boost. Food wasn't giving them enough energy, their unknown glass tanks never seemed to fill up with just their crops or even meat, just satisfied their hunger.
                    So they explored, they studied the local fauna, and one group of <a href="companions.html#pallas">pallas</a> eating down at a nearby cave clumps of coal attaching with their strong grip to the walls of the cave. So, with one volunteer, they mimic what the Pallas did, hesitantly tried it. 
                </p>
                    <p>
                    The sheer excitment of the group when returning to the village was contaigious. The coal was cherished amongst Morrokes. Now, with abilities they didnt know they had, like strong grips to climb any surface like Pallas did.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                    At the Silgans village, they also ha dtheir own discoveries.
                    Silgans created a magic system, since they learned the crystal shards they had inside their own body contained significant amounts of magic. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                    They were too much up in their own heads ,driven by their own culture they have been developing.They didnt have the need to leave their village walls. Mastering the art of combat, making a complex magic system and books upon books of their village's stories. Stories of their own success and grace. Nothing else, nothing more.
                    <br>
                    Though, Nothing drived them crazier than the hatred twoards Morrokes. Though, they didnt even quite seen one, ever.
                    <br>
                    But what could a perfect society need?

                    Over the pass of time, both siblings increased their hatred towards their creations neighbours.  A driven rage. With a lack of a true set goal. That would sooner or later backfire not in favour of the two gods. 
                    It simply started, by one Morroke explorer being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Silgans thought it was a spy. They closed him down into a deep pit since they didn't really have better, and they decided to go investigate. 
                    They found the mork tribe. They found them to be hostile, they really did. Soon, it began.
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-primary mb-3">The great Cold War</h1>
                <p>
                    Devastation. That's all yout need to describe any war. Not only creatures frantically murdered, but so much of their surroundings would need a lot of help to recover from the state it was left in.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                    Garbles were  used as a strong mount, but only the best tamers could make garbles even think of going into the front lines. 
                    <br>
                    Silgans did not win in quantity. But Oâ€™kres where strong companions you did not want to have as an enemy. 
                    <br>
                    Morrokes strategized plans of attack while Silgans where more onto going in brute, but strategized, force.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                    The war stayed in for many rotations. It ended on a sunny morning. After a long winter.
                    <br>
                    Oâ€™kres with enough of being used as weapons more than a companion were leaving, quickly. Morrokes were starting to get scared. There were not many of them left. Silgans were quickly running out of magic, but at the end, magic won. 
                    <br>
                     Morrokes, with nearing 10 soldiers, raised their hands up and walked back, slowly, into the fog. That was it... Or was it?

                        Valdor won the war, they where the greatest creator. Silar seeing their sibling leaving the perimeter of the planet, decided to stay. Overlooking what was going to happen next to their creations. Valdor up in their own head, didnt even notice Silar didnt follow them. Silar lifted the curse, the hatred was gone.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Back in Vaoneha, Silgans chained all of the Morroke Soldiers in the pit with the remainings of the once an explorer. That same night it was a celebration. Silgans celebrated their victory, but at what cost. O'kre where not on their side anymore, and they massacrted thousands of inocent creatures.. all of the wise Silgans reunited to write about the war said night, the more they wrote the less sense it made as of why they even fought in the first place. And so, the sun rised, the village heard a loud horn nosie. Morrokes, with their hands up. No weapons, no armour. They seemed they wanted to talk. The curse may have been lifted but the memories where still there. Silgans kept their guard up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Morrokes and Silgans, face to face in what seemed a civil meeting, they explained how that same night, Morrokes didnt understand why they fought to death, such slaughter. Silgans thought the same. After much talk, Silgans decided to make truce, a pact. To learn from eachother and to not let the past repeat itself. And so, that was it. Some Silgans and Morrokes allthough free from the curse, decided to leave, start anew. They made smaller villages all over the lands, some where the two species coexisted, some, where only Morrokes or Silgans where allowed.
